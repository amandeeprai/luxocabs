From limos to sedans, to stretch SUVs, and others, you can get an idea of what is available to you to choose from for your event. Some companies have a few vehicles to choose from, while others provide many more choices. Of course, the smaller the company, the fewer cars they'll likely have to offer. Our company is proud to offer many different types of luxury vehicles for your consideration. At this time, we are happy to report that we have more than 500 vehicles in pristine condition, ready for your special event.

Sometimes, word-of-mouth is your best bet for finding an excellent limo service. Ask around; maybe a friend or relative, or a coworker will have a recommendation, and they'd be willing to share. Getting a first-hand referral is the best way to select your limo company. Here at LuxoCabs, we are only too happy to offer our testimonials for your review.

                <p>
                        Naturally, the price is a significant factor when deciding which limo service to use for your special event. There can be quite a bit of variable here when comparing available limo service companies. One thing to be aware of is that many limo companies add several layers of fees on top of their base rate. While some segments are necessary, as, in governmental regulations, a few are not. There may be fuel charges, toll charges, administration costs, and gratuity for the chauffeur. Suddenly, your bill could be 30% higher than initially quoted! Whatever the fee, try to get an all-inclusive fair rate. At LuxoCabs, we try our best to keep costs down; we know what it's like to want to merely have a luxurious limo ride for a memorable time. We want you to remember the event, and not have the expenses overshadowing your memory.

                        Experience in the limousine service business is essential. There is much to do when preparing to coordinate a successful ride. Hiring an experienced limo service is the best way to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible. Drivers and staff having in-depth experience in all things related to professional limousine service are optimal. If you come across a newer company, check out the staff's expertise. LuxoCabs has been in business for more than ten years. Our team, many of them, have been with us from the start and a few have had previous experience in the limo service field. Additionally, virtually all of our staff - from the officepersonnel to drivers, to mechanics - have been in the service industry and know how to serve customers in a friendly, efficient manner.

                            Yes, safety isn't necessarily very sexy, but it's vital to ensure a great experience. Check to make sure the limo company holds a valid certification. How much liability insurance do they have? What kind of training does the company use for their chauffeurs? Are their vehicles inspected and approved by local motor vehicle laws? At LuxoCabs, we check and triple check all vehicles before they ever leave the lot. We keep thorough records of vehicle repairs and servicing of each and every vehicle. Our chauffeurs perform a quality overview before starting up the vehicle for any job, no matter the size or length of time of the situation. Our company is certified and is in full compliance with all local regulatory and safety requirements. Our drivers are thoroughly trained and have periodic assessments of their proficiency. Each vehicle is 100% insured for liability.

                            If possible, take the time to see the vehicle you want to rent. If it's a significant event, such as a wedding or prom night, it's essential to have the right sense of the type of size requirement needed for the event. Imagine how devastating it would be if the vehicle your ordered were not sufficient in size to transport your entire party! That would undoubtedly be a deflating experience. Likewise, if the limo you ordered showed up and it was an old, dilapidated model. One way to get a good sense of the vehicle is to take a look at the photographs on the company website. Ask the company to show you the exact model you are expecting to see at the start of the event. LuxoCabs has many full-sized photographs available on our website for your perusal. If you require further details about the vehicle assigned to your event, please don't hesitate to inquire. Our staff is more than happy to accommodate your requests for more information. We want you to have no worries about the vehicle's physical appearance, safety, and reliability.

Whatever the case, make sure each vehicle is inspected regularly and adequately by professionals. The goal for each company is to have working vehicles that run smoothly. Check to make sure the company has valid certification. Also, make sure they have sufficient insurance and that their drivers are professionally trained.
